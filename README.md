# Spotify Scrub (Library Exporter)

Export your Spotify library (playlists, liked tracks, top artists, recently played, etc.) to **CSV and JSON** files using Python + Spotipy.

## Features
- Exports data to **CSV and JSON** files in subfolders (`spotify csvs` and `spotify jsons`)  
- Works by interactively prompting for your **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET**

---

## Requirements
- macOS (tested), Python **3.9+** recommended  
- Python packages: `pandas`, `spotipy`

---

## Quick Start (Mac)

1. **Download** this repository and put `spotify_scrub.py` in a new folder.

2. **Install Python** (if you don’t already have it):  
   - macOS: `brew install python` (or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python3 -m pip install pandas spotipy
   ```

   Or with a `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pandas
   spotipy
   ```

5. **Create a Spotify for Developers app**  
   - Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard  
   - Log in with your Spotify account; click **Create app**  
   - **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?** → *Web API*  
   - **Redirect URIs** → add:  
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback/
     ```
   - Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

6. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python3 spotify_scrub.py
   ```
   - You will be prompted:
     - “Please enter your CLIENT_ID”
     - “Please enter your CLIENT_SECRET”
   - Then a browser window will open for Spotify login/consent.

7. **Email access rules — important**  
   Your Spotify email must **either**:
   - Be the same email that owns the Spotify Developer app **or**
   - Be added to the app’s **User Management** in the Developer Dashboard

---

## The following scopes will be granted to the script:
```python
"user-library-read",        # liked songs, saved albums/shows/episodes
"playlist-read-private",
"playlist-read-collaborative",
"user-follow-read",         # followed artists
"user-top-read",            # top artists/tracks
"user-read-recently-played" # recently played (last 50)
```

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Redirect URI mismatch**  
- Error: *INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI*  
- Fix: Make sure the **exact** URI `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback/` is added in your Spotify app settings.

**Stuck with a bad token / changed scopes**  
- Delete the local Spotipy cache file:
  ```bash
  rm .cache*
  ```
  Then re-run the script to re-login.

**403 / some playlists missing**  
- Private or collaborative playlists require `playlist-read-private` and `playlist-read-collaborative`.  
- Also verify the user is allowed in **User Management** for the app.

**Wrong account logging in**  
- If the browser auto-logs into a different Spotify account, open a private window and re-run so you can choose the correct account.

## Expected Outputs

After running, two directories will be created:

### `spotify csvs`
```
errors.csv            saved_albums.csv        top_artists_all.csv
followed_artists.csv  saved_episodes.csv      top_tracks_4w.csv
liked_songs.csv       saved_shows.csv         top_tracks_6m.csv
playlist_tracks.csv   top_artists_4w.csv      top_tracks_all.csv
playlists.csv         top_artists_6m.csv
```

### `spotify jsons`
```
followed_artists.json  saved_episodes.json     top_tracks_4w.json
liked_songs.json       saved_shows.json        top_tracks_6m.json
playlist_tracks.json   top_artists_4w.json     top_tracks_all.json
playlists.json         top_artists_6m.json
saved_albums.json      top_artists_all.json
```

---

## Development Notes

- Keep `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` **out of version control**.  
- Consider adding these to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .venv/
  .cache*
  spotify csvs/
  spotify jsons/
  ```
